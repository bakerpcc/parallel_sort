OPENMP AND MPI needed to be installed before running the program.
Here is a input.txt (about 8M), in order to save space, I didn't put it into every folder. 
For running and debugging, you should copy it to every fold, or change path from "input.txt" to "../../../input.txt"
In every folder, type make in terminal (for ubuntu OS, I use gcc compiler). Detailed info is in each fold's readme.
Thank you!
